    # TODO: pseudopc_index is a bit of a hack. This problem is that xa
    # (not unreasonably, probably) won't accept forward references in
    # the "* = ..." line emitted by pseudopc_end(). We need to ensure
    # there are labels defined at the start and end of the pseudopc
    # block so they can be used in pseudopc_end without needing any
    # forward references. This hack seems to work in practice, but note
    # that *if* there's already a label in one of these places the
    # labels we add here are redundant and may not be referenced. I
    # don't know if we can (easily/at all) detect when this happens;
    # perhaps we can/should add a "weak" label definition which is only
    # emitted if it's used, though that might be more complex than
    # necessary. I *think* the fact we are using the move ID with the
    # labels here and in pseudopc_end() means we won't end up having
    # get_label() decide to return us a label name for the right
    # address which is defined elsewhere (and potentially after) in
    # the file. If push came to shove we could just forcibly use the
    # pseudopc_start_xxx labels in pseudopc_end() instead of going via
    # get_label(); that might in fact be the cleanest solution all
    # round, although it wouldn't be unreasonable for a user to want to
    # be able to control the label names. Perhaps moves could be given
    # an optional name which is used when generating these labels
    # instead of auto-generating them using a numeric sequence, though
    # that might be a bit assembler-specific. - OK, gfoot's repton2
    # disassembly shows the problem where get_label() picks an
    # "unacceptable" label for pseudopc_end(), so although this may
    # indicate a sub-optimal choice of label in general, I will just
    # hard-code the use of these labels. OK, that *still* doesn't work...
